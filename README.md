My name is Ishan Phadte and I'm a 4th year Computer Science Student at the University of Ottawa

I have done freelancing work where I created a React Website for a Small Business to boost sales. 

My programming interests include Web Development and Cloud Computing. However, I am more than interested in venturing into new avenues if the opportunity presents itself. I am currently studying for my AWS Developer and DevOps Certifications

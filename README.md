My name is Ishan Phadte and I'm a 4th year Computer Science Student at the University of Ottawa. I am currently studying for my AWS Developer and DevOps Certifications while still managing my school work. 

I am currently seeking a Summer 2024 Internship job so don't be shy to reach out via [Email](mailto:ishanphadte@gmail.com)

Here are a selection of my standout projects from my diverse portfolio:
